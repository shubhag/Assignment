How to run:

a) Heartbeat
==================
python heartbeat-server.py 		#this starts the server on port 8080

								#On monitoring machine that hear heartbeat of server, run
python heartbeat-monitor.py 	#change the host in client.py code with the server's ip-								#address before running python code

Working
==================

Server connects with the monitor using socket. It then sends heartbeat after every 1 second.

Monitor connects with the server. It listens to the heartbeat of the server. If it is unable to hear heartbeat or ping in 5 seconds, it displays heartbeat is down. 


b)Ping/Echo
============================
python ping-server.py 			#this starts the server on port 8080

								#On monitoring machine that pings and hear heartbeat of server, run
python ping-monitor.py 			#change the host in client.py code with the server's ip-								#address before running python code

Working
============================
Monitor sends ping message to the server using socket. Server on receiving ping message, sends back echo message to the monitor. 

When monitor is unable to listen to the echo message even after 5 seconds of wait, it declares fault with the server.


Note:
=====================
Port should be same in both server and monitor. Variable is "port" in python code. If running on different machine or on a VM, change the monitor "host" to that of the ip-address of the server.
